## Description
The project aim was to create a digital twin of a production system using the simulation software Automod. 
The whole description of the project is contained in the "technical report.pdf" file included in the repository.

The underlying production system is a drive-in and the main points we focused on are: 
- the production process,
- the order and menu management,
- the meal delivery,
- the restocking policy for the production stations, and
- the reduction of the overall waiting time.

Ad-hoc 3D models were developed for the project, which must be inserted manually in the respective Automod folder before the execution. To do that, it is enough to copy all the models contained in the "custom models" folder of this project directory into the dedicated Automod folder (which usually has a path similar to "C:\AutoMod\12_6\demos\graphics\cell").

The folder "Python scripts" includes the code to generate the data we used during the simulations. More details about these scripts can be found in the report.
